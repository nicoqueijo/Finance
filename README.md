**M1 Finance Rebalancing Calculator/Simulator**

M1 Finance is an investing platform which allows users to invest using fractional shares and custom weighting.

I've created a spreadsheet which simulates how a given portfolio would've perfomed in previous years using the M1 Finance investing platform. Given a list of stocks, a target weight for each, and monthly contributions, this spreadsheet calculates returns for the calendar years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and compares them with other benchmarks such as the S&P 500.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
